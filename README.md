Welcome to my Personal Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of embedded systems and software projects I have developed, covering real-time systems, automation, authentication, and compiler tools.

**Projects**

1. Digital Watch
A real-time digital watch system using RTC DS1307 with I2C and UART communication. The watch displays:
✅ Time, Date, and Day
✅ Allows users to dynamically set time and date
✅ Real-time clock accuracy ensured with external RTC module
Technologies Used: Embedded C, RTC DS1307, I2C, UART

2. Home Automation
A smart home automation system utilizing an HC-05 Bluetooth module to enable wireless control of home appliances.
✅ Users can control smart LEDs and other appliances via a mobile app
✅ Enhances energy efficiency and ease of use
✅ Bluetooth-based wireless communication
Technologies Used: Embedded C, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, Mobile App Interface

3. RFID-Based Attendance System
An RFID authentication-based employee attendance system with accurate timestamp logging.
✅ Uses RTC DS1307 for precise entry and exit timestamps
✅ Secure and automated attendance tracking
✅ Stores attendance records for efficient employee management
Technologies Used: Embedded C, RFID Module, RTC DS1307, UART


4. Preprocessor Stages
A C preprocessor tool designed for embedded applications, optimizing code readability and compilation.
✅ Removes comments from C source code
✅ Replaces macros (without arguments)
✅ Handles header file inclusion automatically
Technologies Used: C, Preprocessor Directives

**Development Environment**

Microcontroller: LPC2129
IDE: Keil uVision
Programming Language: Embedded C

**How to Use**

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-projects.git
cd personal-projects
2. Browse project folders for source code and documentation.
3. Copy the code and Compile (for LPC2129) using Keil uVision.
4. Use the HEX file to test the behaviour in Proteus.
